# Qualifying Metrics for Perceived Human Behavior in AI Agents

### Problem Statement
Determining the main metrics of navigation which will distinguish human or AI agents within an environment

### Proposed Solution

* Virtually model a crowd situation and compare metrics of humans vs. AI
* Group of agents evacuating a room through a bottleneck/door
* One of the agents will be controlled by a human
* Collect data from agents and use logistic regression classifier to determine if the classes are separable
* Recordings of these scenes are shown to human participants
* Participants select which agent in the scene they believe to be humans, not AI
